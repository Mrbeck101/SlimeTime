This is a Unity Project for CSI5610 

The code here is not executable as it requires Unity engine to run, so I have also provided the build of the game with my deliverables.

The controls are simple A to move left, D to move right, Space to Jump, Shift to charge jump distance, Shift+Space to increase jump distance and height.

The UI has an obliterate button and Version button to revisit the past and go to previous versions. Clicking the obliterate button will destroy your character and allow you save that version to revisit later. Clicking version will bring up the version menu where you can click on any past previous version. to exit this menu press Esc.

All the code here is executable if you import the code into unity along with all assets.
